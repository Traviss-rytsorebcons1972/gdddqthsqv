Just walked out of Janym Qazaqstan. Wow. My brain feels like a kaleidoscope rn. Theater was a madhouse, popcorn everywhere, like a crunchy carpet. My back is on strike from those seats. Wasn't expecting that explosion of colors at the end, like someone dipped the screen in fluorescent paint just becuz they could.

Halfway through, that scene with the horse running in slow motion. I swear it reminded me of my uncle's backyard, where everything was always in slo-mo for no reason at all. And the music! Like a whale orchestra playing in a cherry blossom field. And then bam! That twist where the portrait cried. I mean, who even thinks of that? It’s like dreaming with your eyes open, cuz that’s totally a thing now apparently.

> Felt a little like reading a poem written by a robot at 3am. The dialogue was like cotton candy—it melted before I could even hold on to it. Oh, and the popcorn again, got stuck in my teeth. But there was something comforting about that chaos.

Honestly, my phone keep buzzing. I think Marcy told me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . Or did she want to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   like, at her place? My mind's a blender right now. Need to detox from all the visual overload. Movie's like a guinea pig on a skateboard—unexpected, a bit wobbly, but charming in its own way. Can’t believe the snake scene, it's still slithering in my brain, uninvited and all.

Remember that part with the stars, how they went pop pop pop? Made me think of that time the power went out and we tried to play board games by candlelight, getting the rules all wrong but having a blast anyway. Same vibes. Genius or madness? Maybe both.
